1.
if(karel.canPickThing())                                    
{                                                        
    karel.turnRight();                               
} else {                                                   
    karel.turnLeft();                                
}                      

If karel can pick a thing, he will turn right. // 1same
If he cannot pick a thing he will turn left. // 2same

2.
if(!karel.canPickThing())
{                                                                          
    karel.turnLeft();
} else {                                                                                                                          
    karel.turnRight();
}       

If karel cannot pick a thing, he will turn left. // 2same
If karel cannot not pick thing, he will turn right. 
Therefore, if karel CAN pick thing, he will turn right. // 1same

In conclusion, the two codes complete the same process.
